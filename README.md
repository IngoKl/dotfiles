# Dotfiles (Ingo Kleiber)

This a basic set of dotfiles which I use to set up a basic (Linux) system. The installer isn't particularly advanced, but it works in most cases.
The dotfiles themselves are kept very simple as I like to modify them further for each individual system.

## Installation

### Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/IngoKl/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install_linux.sh

```

### Windows 10

```
git clone https://github.com/IngoKl/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
install_windows.bat

```
